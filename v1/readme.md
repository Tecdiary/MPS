# Welcome to MPS Guide (WIP)

#### Modern POS Solution Documentation (version 1.0)

## About MPS

**Modern POS Solution** (**MPS**) is all in once business solution developed by **Tecdiray IT Solutions**. MPS is developed using **Vuejs** (front-end) and **Laravel** (back-end). All licenses come with source code of back-end but the front-end source code is not included in regular license. If you need to modify the item's front-end for yourself or your clients then you will need to purchase standard or extended license.

This item is compatible with most of the tax systems including SST, VAT and state level taxes such as in _Canada_ & _India_.

We have tried to make this documentation as comprehensive as we can and will keep update time to time with new details and FAQs. Please read the manual and if you can't find answer of your questions, please ask at **[support portal](https://tecdiary.net/support)**
