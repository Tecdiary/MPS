## General

Modern POS Solution is designed & developed to for small to enterprise business needs. We have tried to keep design and layout simple so that everyone can easily get going. The design is responsive and we have added the progressive web app feature to it. MPS look quite fine on all screen sizes.

You can have the option to use sidebar as collapsed (mini sidebar, menu will popup on right).

All the tables are search-able & sort-able with responsive styles, on the small screens, you can scroll to left to see data.
