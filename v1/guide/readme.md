## General

Modern POS Solution is designed & developed to suit most of the business needs. We have tried to keep design and layout simple so that that everyone can easily get going. The design is responsive and we have added the progressive web app feature to it. MPS look quite fine on all screen sizes.

You can have the option to use sidebar as collapsed (mini sidebar, menu will popup on right).

All the tables are search-able & sort-able with responsive styles, on the small screens, you can scroll to left to see data.

## Dashboard

Dashboard has week, monthly and yearly charts with date and year selection.

We would like to listen your feedback to improve and make dashboard more informative.

## Calendar / Events

Calendar UI is simple & easy, you can add events and they will mark a dot on calendar. User will get email notification before 2 days and 1 day of the event.

## Activity Logs

MPS will automatically logs all the activity in your app and you can view it under reports. The activity table is search-able.
